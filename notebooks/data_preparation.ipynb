    "To train our model we require a dataset for previous FPL seasons. Unfortunately, the FPL API only provides data for the current season - this data will be used to make predictions and optimise our team, but cannot be used for training. \n",
    "<br><br> Luckily, data from previous seasons is available on github (https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League). Data from the 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons is used. Various statistics are calculated to incorporate player and team form (see `data_statistics.py` for details), aswell as performance from the previous season. The data is stored in a csv file.\n",
    "<br><br> FPL has a Double Gameweek feature where some teams play 2 games in a single GW (and in other GWs they will not play). To take this into account we introduce a new variable 'total_GW_points' which gives the total number of points scored by a player for that Gamewek. For the majority of cases, the value of 'points' and 'total_GW_points' will be indentical but they may differ in the case of double GWs."
